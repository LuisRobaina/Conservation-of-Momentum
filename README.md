# Conservation-of-Momentum
 An elastic collision is a collision in which there is no net loss in kinetic energy in the system as a result of the collision. Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved quantities in elastic collisions. This java program lets you play with a system of arbritary particles to see physics in action. Enjoy !
